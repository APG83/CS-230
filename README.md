# CS 230 Software Design Document – The Gaming Room

This repository contains my completed software design document for **The Gaming Room** client project from CS 230.  
It is part of my Computer Science portfolio, demonstrating my ability to analyze requirements, design software architecture, and communicate effectively with clients and development teams.

## Reflection

### The Gaming Room Client and Requirements  
The Gaming Room was my client, and they wanted to expand their game *Draw It or Lose It* into a web-based application that could run across multiple platforms. The software needed to support multiple players, manage teams, ensure that no duplicate games were running, and be accessible in a distributed environment. My task was to design a system that met these requirements and clearly communicate the architecture to both the client and the development team.  

### What I Did Well  
I feel that I did particularly well in breaking down the system architecture into clear sections that explained each platform’s strengths and limitations. I also explained trade-offs so that the client could make informed decisions.  

### Helpful Parts of the Design Process  
Working through the design document was very helpful when transitioning to development. It gave me a structured plan and forced me to think about how components would interact before writing any code. This reduced confusion later and made implementation more straightforward.  

### What I Would Revise  
If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the design considerations for scalability. While I addressed performance and memory usage, I could have gone deeper into how the system could grow over time, such as adding more servers or supporting higher concurrency.  

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs  
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on how players and teams would actually interact with the system and ensuring that only one unique game instance could exist at a time. Considering user needs is critical in software design because the software is built to serve them—ignoring those needs risks building a technically sound system that fails in usability or usefulness.  

### My Approach to Software Design  
I approached software design by first analyzing requirements, then comparing platforms, and finally structuring the architecture in a way that mapped the client’s needs to technical solutions. Going forward, I would continue using this requirements-first approach, but I would also incorporate user stories and diagrams earlier in the process to better visualize the flow of data and user interactions.
